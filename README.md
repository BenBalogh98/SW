current long-term plans:
the game, which alredy exists in form of a console application, but sitting in a different repository.

This will be able to save the games, load them and save either only the high scores or the whole game to the backend/database.
So this will need a login.

web application, where user can log in and do.... idk what.

backend. Will definitely run in a kubernetes environment. Much later.
